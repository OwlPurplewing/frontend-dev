# Report an Issue on GitHub

![report issue](http://diy-visualpedia.s3.amazonaws.com/new-issue.png)

Github makes it easy to let the repo author know when you've found a mistake or have an idea for a new feature. All you need to do is go to a repo's page on Github.com and click the `Issue` button, then `New Issue`. Just fill out the boxes describing the issue and click `Submit new Issue`. That's it!

This guide is open and on GitHub at [github.com/diy/opensourcerer.diy.org](https://github.com/diy/opensourcerer.diy.org). We'd love your feedback on how we can improve it - now that you've got a Github account, submit an issue. If you can't think of anything you'd like to see changed, just say hi!

#### To complete the challenge, upload a screenshot of an issue report!
