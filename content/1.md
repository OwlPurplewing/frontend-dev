# Create a Repo on GitHub

## Get a GitHub Account
First things first, create a free account on [www.Github.com](http://www.GitHub.com). If you're under 13, you'll need a parent's email and help to set up the account.

Parts of the page:

1. **Organization** Companies and organizations have accounts on GitHub to keep their projects together.
1. **Members** Are the GitHub users that contribute to an organizations projects. They are sometimes employees or others close to the organization. 
3. **Repository** These are projects on GitHub, they contain all the project's instructions and files. Often people say "repo," short for repository. Public repos are open source!

### Explore the Repo
Go to [Github.com/diy](http://github.com/diy) and click the repo named [open-sourcerer](http://www.GitHub.com/diy/open-sourcerer). Now you're on the page for this repo. You can see the files inside the repo, the `readme.md` gives you instructions for using the project and you can see when changes have been made to the files, these are called *commits*.

Awesome! Now you've created your very own repo. 

## Edit a File
You can actually edit files right in GitHub.com! Click the linked blue filename, README.md. Next, click `Edit`.

You've now got a text box that you can type directly into. Once you've made changes, add a short `commit summary.` This is your **commit message** that summarizes the changes you've made. Then click `commit changes`! 

#### To complete the challenge, upload a screenshot of your first repo!
