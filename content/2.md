# Fork a Repo on Github.com
 
When you create a copy of a repo that was orginally created by someone else it's called a **fork**. It's a **remote** copy, meaning the files are stored on GitHub.com. It also stays linked to the original repo that you copied it from.

1. If you're not already there, go to [GitHub.com/diy](http://github.com/diy) and click on the repo [open-sourcerer](https://github.com/diy/open-sourcerer).
2. Near the top right, click `Fork`. Check out that animation! This means we're creating a linked copy of the code onto our account.

#### To complete the challenge, upload a screenshot of the repo you forked (PS - you can fork as many repos as you want, but make sure you also fork [open-sourcerer](https://github.com/diy/open-sourcerer), because we'll use that later!).
